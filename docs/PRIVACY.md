## Privacy Policy of Gmail Filter Editor

Last updated: 2025-05-22

### 1. Introduction

Gmail Filter Editor (hereinafter referred to as the "App") highly values your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy provides information on how the App handles your information. By using this App, you consent to this Privacy Policy.

### 2. Information We Do Not Collect

The App does not collect, store, share, or track any of your personally identifiable information. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Your name, email address (Google handles authentication when you log in, and the App does not store this).
- IP address, device information, usage history.
- Gmail email content or other personal data.

### 3. Information We Access and Why

The App requires you to log in with your Google Account and requests the following Google Account permissions to manage your Gmail filters:

- Permission to view, create, and delete Gmail filters (e.g., gmail.settings.basic or similar scope)
  - Purpose: This permission is used exclusively for the App's core functionality: to view, create, modify, and delete Gmail filters at your request. The App does not use this permission for any other purpose.
Google Account authentication is handled securely via Google's OAuth 2.0 protocol. The App does not access or store your Google Account password.

### 4. How Your Information is Handled

The App operates as a static web page (client-side application). All data processing (e.g., configuring filter rules) occurs locally within your web browser or communicates directly with your Google Account via Google's official APIs.

There is no separate server for the App's operation; therefore, your Gmail filter information or account details are not transmitted to or stored on any servers owned or operated by the App developer or any third party associated with the App itself.

Your Gmail filter rules and access token (temporary credential of your Gmail account that the App uses to communicate with Google's API server) are temporarily stored in your browser's memory. When you leave the App, the stored data is immediately discarded and no longer accessible.

For your information, 'leaving the app' even includes navigating to 'Help' page or 'Privacy Policy' page.
And you may need to sign in again when you visit again or navigate back to the App.

### 5. Third-Party Services

The only third-party service directly integrated for the core functionality of this App is Google (for authentication and Gmail API access). We encourage you to review Google's Privacy Policy: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

### 6. Data Security

All data is exchanged between your web browser and Google's API server encrypted with Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

Your Gmail filter rules and access token (temporary credential of your Gmail account that the App uses to communicate with Google's API server) are temporarily stored in your browser's memory. When you leave the App, the stored data is immediately discarded and no longer accessible.

For your information, 'leaving the app' even includes navigating to 'Help' page or 'Privacy Policy' page.
And you may need to sign in again when you visit again or navigate back to the App.

### 7. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction) and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

### 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be amended to reflect changes in the law or our service. When amendments are made, we will provide notice through the App's website or a relevant page. The revised Privacy Policy will become effective from the date it is posted. For significant changes, we may provide a more prominent notice. We encourage users to periodically review this policy.
